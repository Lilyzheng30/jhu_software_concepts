# jhu_software_concepts module 1 Personal Website Assignment

Once all module files are downloaded, type (python3 run.py) into the terminal. This will start the application and generate a link that can be used to access the website. If no link appears, you can manually navigate to (http://0.0.0.0:8080).

Upon entering the website, you will see the homepage, which includes my name, position, a brief bio, and a profile picture. In the upper-right corner of the page, there is a navigation bar that allows you to access the different pages of the website: Homepage (the default landing page), Projects, and Contact Info.

When you click on the Projects page, you will see a list of projects I have worked on, along with short descriptions of each project. Each project also includes a link to its GitHub repository, which can be accessed either through a text link or by clicking the GitHub icon.

When you navigate to the Contact Info page, you will find my contact information, including my email address and a link to my LinkedIn profile, which can be accessed by clicking the LinkedIn icon.
